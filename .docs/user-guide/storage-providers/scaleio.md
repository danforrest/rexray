## Overview
The ScaleIO registers a storage driver named `scaleio` with the `REX-Ray`
driver manager and is used to connect and manage ScaleIO storage.

## Configuration
The following is an example configuration of the ScaleIO driver.

```yaml
scaleio:
    endpoint:             https://domain.com/scalio
    insecure:             false
    useCerts:             true
    userName:             admin
    password:             mypassword
    systemID:             0
    systemName:           sysv
    protectionDomainID:   0
    protectionDomainName: corp
    storagePoolID:        0
